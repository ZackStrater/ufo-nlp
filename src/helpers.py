It hovered in one spot.  It looked like a helicopter light at first.  But it was way to bright.  Then it went to a higher height.  Stayed there for a while.  Then disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Report appears to us to be consistent with the sighting of Venus.  PD))"

Not a airplane or any known star.  Flickering in brightness.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus.  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous; provides no contact information.

It reminded me of a drone, but over a dozen drones out flying above our neighborhood all night until the morning is a bit odd.  I went to bed at about 23:00 and woke up at 4:00, they were still out there.  One flew over my fianc√©s and my head and we saw a shape of  what appeared to be a triangle shape.  My dad and mom both saw them from their window and they thought it was quite strange.  I can't believe no one has reported this yet.  I don't know what this is, but they are circling our neighborhood over and over again.  Hovering and they haven't stopped."
